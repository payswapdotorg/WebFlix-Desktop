# Changelog — webflix-contracts

Semver per package (contract-freeze.md §3): breaking changes bump major with
TL2 approval + migration notes; additive changes bump minor with a consumer
impact note. No CHANGELOG existed before 0.2.0 — the 0.1.0 history is the git
log of this package (frozen §2 shapes, D2-LOCAL lane).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-11 — media-intelligence contract module (P4-CONTRACTS)

Phase 4 opener. Adds the media-intelligence shapes the later Phase-4 orders
(P4-ARTIFACTS, P4-ADAPTERS, P4-TRANSCRIBE …) bind to.

### Added

- `src/intelligence.ts` (ADDITIVE; frozen §2.1–2.6 module files untouched):
  - `UserObjective` (+ `TimeBudgets`) — explicit, inspectable, editable user
    goals; never inferred, no silent defaults beyond the documented empty
    objective (phase4-mi-plan §8).
  - `FeedbackEvent` — explicit (thumbs-up/down, pin, not-interested) +
    implicit (watched-fraction, skipped-at) with provenance; id is the
    idempotency key for appends.
  - `LibraryFact` — the local-library ranking projection onto a §2.1 catalog
    item id (a projection, NOT a §2.4 mirror: no path/fingerprint, re-keyed).
  - `RankingPolicy` (+ `RankingPolicyVersion`, `RankingWeights`,
    `RANKING_POLICY_V1_WEIGHTS`) — deterministic, versioned; the version
    alone pins weights/semantics so same inputs + same policy version =>
    byte-for-byte same output.
  - `RankedItem` / `RankingResult` (+ `RankingReason`, `EvidencePointer`,
    `NonEmptyArray`, `RankingEmptyReason`) — reasons are MANDATORY: enforced
    at the type level (`NonEmptyArray`), the schema level (`.min(1)`) and the
    domain runtime guard. Honest-empty variants: empty-catalog /
    no-local-signals / no-ranked-candidates.
  - `RankerPort` (+ `RankerInput`) — the user-selected adapter interface;
    pure, local-only, no hidden LLM. Default implementation = the built-in
    deterministic ranker shipped in webflix-domain (P4-CONTRACTS).
  - `DerivedArtifact` (+ `ArtifactLineage`, closed `DerivedArtifactKind`
    enum: transcript | summary | overview | translation | dubbing | qa) —
    structural original/derived separation; persistence deferred to
    P4-ARTIFACTS.
- `src/errors.ts`: six MI codes appended to `ErrorCode`
  (intelligence/policy-unsupported, objective-invalid, feedback-invalid,
  feedback-conflict, ranking-invalid, artifact-invalid) — appended under the
  enum's own additive-only rule; no existing code repurposed.
- `src/index.ts`: `export * from "./intelligence"` (entrypoint wiring only).

### Consumer impact (additive only — §3 method)

- No breaking changes. No frozen §2.1–2.6 shape edited; existing consumers
  compile and behave identically.
- New exports resolve through the existing single entrypoint
  (`webflix-contracts`); downstream packages gained the MI domain rules
  (webflix-domain) and use cases (webflix-application) in the same order —
  their package versions stay 0.1.0 this order (no version bump mandated;
  the freeze table already registers their dependency edges).
- `ErrorCode` grew by append-only entries; switch statements over the enum
  are unaffected (the set is open by design).
